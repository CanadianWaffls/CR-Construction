This is a website project for my grade 11 computer science class where I have been tasked to make a website using html for a fictional construction company, 
my teacher who is pretending to be the customer will periodically send new emails of what else to add in the website like a real customer might. The emails are below.
_____________________________________________________________
Hello, we are a recently formed construction company
looking for a website to be made. We want to have a very
impactful home page with a full-size background image (or
video if you can?) of anything construction related. Maybe a
saw or building a wall??? On the home page, it should have our
name "CR Construction" somewhere. If you could make us a logo,
that would be great too! We need some sort of navigation bar
at the top so that people can access our three pages. We need
Home, Pricing and Contact Us.

The home page is what I mentioned above, full screen and
simple. The Pricing page should have 3 boxes side by side with
different pricing. I will provide these later on. For now,
just set them up as Bronze, Silver, Gold pricing levels.
Lastly, the Contact Us page should have our contact
information. I can provide this later as well. Could you maybe
add a map too? That would be awesome.

Hey I forgot to say that our logo can be any colours
you like. Maybe yellow and black though, sort of construction-
like. Talk soon...

It's been a week since I sent in my request. Can you please 
send me a screenshot of what you've got so far? Thanks.

Here is the pricing scheme.
Bronze $5,000.00, includes 2-worker team, maximum 40 hours.
Silver $10,000.00, includes 4-worker team, maximum 40 hours.
Gold $20,000.00, includes 4-worker team, maximum 80 hours.
I'm not sure which equipment I should offer, feel free to 
include whatever you think would be a good idea 

(excavators, dump trucks, etc.)

Final Touches

Message: I hope everything is going well. The progress photos
 look great. I have a few suggestions to make about the layout 
 and handling of different pages. 

1. Can you please make sure that the nav bar stays in the same 
spot on all 3 (or more) pages?

2. The colour scheme should be the same on all pages so it 
doesn't look like people are going to a whole new website..

3. My colleagues aren't the most tech-savvy people so when you 
submit the final version of the website, could you please make 
sure everything is in a folder and then send it as a .zip file?
 This will help ensure the site works and everything is in the 
 proper spot. You may need to modify your a href="" locations so
  it doesn't take us to YOUR C://documents but just takes us to 
  the home.html or contact.html etc. 

Can't wait to see the final product on Friday!
